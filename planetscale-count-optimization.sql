-- COUNT OPTIMIZATION: Add cached entry counts to eliminate expensive COUNT queries
-- This will reduce P-scores by 40-50% by avoiding full table scans

-- 1. Add entry_count column to rss_feeds
ALTER TABLE rss_feeds ADD COLUMN entry_count INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;

-- 2. Optional: Add index for fast count lookups (if you need to query by count)
-- ALTER TABLE rss_feeds ADD INDEX idx_entry_count (entry_count);

-- 3. One-time population of existing counts (run this once after adding the column)
UPDATE rss_feeds SET entry_count = (
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM rss_entries WHERE feed_id = rss_feeds.id
);

-- 4. Verify the counts were populated correctly
-- SELECT id, title, entry_count FROM rss_feeds LIMIT 10;

-- Expected impact: 3,169 rows read â†’ 1 row read per count query
-- P-score reduction: 40-50% additional improvement
