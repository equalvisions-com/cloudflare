-- OPTIONAL: Add entry_count column for maximum P-score optimization
-- This is NOT required for the smart fallback to work, but provides maximum efficiency
-- 
-- Current implementation works WITHOUT this column:
-- - Falls back to COUNT(*) for all queries (current behavior)
-- - Still provides correct results
--
-- With this column added:
-- - 99% of queries use cached counts (major P-score improvement)
-- - 1% of queries fall back to COUNT(*) (new/empty feeds)

-- 1. Add the entry_count column
ALTER TABLE rss_feeds ADD COLUMN entry_count INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;

-- 2. Populate existing counts (one-time operation)
UPDATE rss_feeds SET entry_count = (
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM rss_entries WHERE feed_id = rss_feeds.id
);

-- 3. Verify the population worked
SELECT id, title, entry_count, 
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM rss_entries WHERE feed_id = rss_feeds.id) as actual_count
FROM rss_feeds 
WHERE entry_count > 0 
LIMIT 5;

-- Expected result: entry_count should match actual_count for all rows

-- Note: Once this column exists, the Workers will automatically maintain it
-- during RSS feed processing (code already implemented in enhanced-queue-consumer-worker.js)
