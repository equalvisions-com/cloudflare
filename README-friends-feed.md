# Friends Feed Implementation

This feature adds a new "Friends" feed tab that displays a combined feed of activities from a user's friends, merging functionality from both the RSS feed display and user activity components.

## Components Created

1. **FriendsFeedClient.tsx**
   - Displays friend activities (likes, comments, retweets) grouped by RSS entry
   - Combines UI patterns from both RSSFeedClient and UserActivityFeed
   - Shows friend interactions with their profile images
   - Includes infinite scrolling with virtualization

2. **API Routes**
   - `/api/friends/activity` - Server endpoint to fetch friend activities

3. **Convex Functions**
   - `getFriends` - Returns a user's friends (accepted friendships)
   - `getFriendActivities` - Returns activities from friends with entry details and metrics
   - `getFriendRequests` - Returns pending friend requests
   - `sendFriendRequest` - Sends a friend request
   - `respondToFriendRequest` - Accepts or rejects a friend request

## Integration Points

1. **FeedTabsContainer**
   - Added a new "Friends" tab alongside "Discover" and "Following"
   - Passes friend activity data to the FriendsFeedClient

2. **Page Component**
   - Updated to fetch friend activity data
   - Passes data to FeedTabsContainer

## UI Features

1. **Activity Display**
   - Shows who liked, commented, or retweeted content
   - Displays the related RSS entry with full content
   - Shows comment content if available

2. **Interaction Support**
   - Users can like, comment, or retweet directly from the Friends feed
   - Interaction counts are accurate and synchronized with the rest of the app

3. **Empty States**
   - Shows appropriate messages when:
     - User is not logged in
     - User has no friends
     - Friends have no activity

## Data Flow

1. Server fetches friend activities from Convex
2. Activities are grouped by RSS entry
3. Entry details and metrics are attached to each group
4. Client renders the grouped activities with virtualization
5. Additional activities are loaded as the user scrolls

## Technical Notes

- Uses React Virtuoso for efficient rendering of large lists
- Combines interaction patterns from both the RSS and Activity components
- Shares styling and UI patterns with existing components
- Fully typed with TypeScript interfaces
